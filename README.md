## Summary: 
As the results are showing there is not much of difference in temperatures between the month of June and the monnth of December.
The only thing might be mentioned would be the difference in the lowest temperatures (64 °F vs 56 °F). 
Maybe people would find ice cream and surfing more interesting in June for the average temperature of 64 °F but it should not be a huge problem.
Good thing is that the hightest temperature in both months are relatively high (85 °F vs 83 °F) and comfortable so it would be awesome to go out to
the water to suft and get some ice cream in both months!
